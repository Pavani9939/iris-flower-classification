#  Iris Flower Classification

## Objective
Build a Machine Learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on sepal and petal measurements.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Iris Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)
- **Features**: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width
- **Target**: Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

##  How to Run
To run this project:
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells

---

## Model Used
- **Random Forest Classifier**

---

## Results
Using the Random Forest model, we achieved **100% accuracy** on the test dataset, due to its clean and balanced nature.

---

## Visualizations
- **Pairplot**: To explore feature relationships
- **Confusion Matrix**: To evaluate model performance

---

## Conclusion
This project was a great introduction to classification using Machine Learning. It helped me understand the end-to-end workflow of:
- Data preparation
- Model training
- Evaluation and visualization
